TEXT ANIMATOR BY TOM BENNETT


IMPORTANT NOTE: ONLY WORKS WITH TEXT MESH PRO

Thank you for using my janky little Text Animator.


NOTE: If the demo scene only loads one text component, press play a couple times to fix it.


How To Use:

Setting UP

 - Firstly add the "TextAnimator" script to any TMP object/s in your scene.

 - Adjust the slider to increase or decrease the number of affects that you wish to use.

 - Select your desired affect from the dropdown. Every affect has parameters which you can adjust to your liking.

 - Go into play mode to see your animations take place!!

 IMPORTANT NOTE: When using "Swinging Text" you can not have more than 1024 character (including spaces).


Including and Excluding Words/Sentances

 - if you want one word/sentence to have the affect applied to then select "Include" from the drop down and
   within "Word/s to Affect" write the word/sentence which u want to affect. 

 - if you want one word/sentence to NOT have the affect applied to then select "Exclude" from the drop down and 
   within "Word/s to Affect" write the word/sentence which u want to NOT affect.

 IMPORTANT NOTE:
   (It is cap sensitive and if you have multiple of the same word within the sentence then it will only apply to 
   the first word, e.g sentence is "i like cats and i like dogs". if you wrote "like" in the "Word/s to Affect" only the "like"
   before cats would be affected)
