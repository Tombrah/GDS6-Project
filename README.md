                   How to Play
------------------------------------------------
#Note: 2 Players Needed!

1. One player will create a lobby and might even give it a name.
2. Once created another player will list the lobbies and join
   the respective lobby of their friend. 
3. Both players will ready up, starting a countdown to load the 
   game scene!

4. Players will take it in turns playing both the Cop and the Robber.
5. The Robber aims to steal as many items as they can within the time
   limit to stack up points.
6. The Cop aims to catch the robber reducing the rounds time limit and
   providing them with a small amount of points.

7. The player with the most points at the end of the rounds WINS!!

------------------------------------------------
                 Expected Outcome
------------------------------------------------

This version will demo the majority foundation of our game, showcasing 
the ability for semi functioning online multiplayer. It will show off
some of both the cop and the robbers different abilities and provides 
a base layout for the map. Low poly models also provide a base design
for the player characters.

------------------------------------------------
                    Known Bugs
------------------------------------------------

1. There is the occasional chance for the players to not properly connect
   when loading the game scene. (Game must be fully restarted to fix)
2. Game can be quite laggy depending on the device it is played on.
3. Sometimes holding right click with the cop, to "scope" in, will cause 
   the camera to jitter rapidly.
4. The taser bullet doesn't properly stun the robber almost all the time.
5. Spammin E as the cop to catch the robber can count as multiple catches
   and give more points than intended.
